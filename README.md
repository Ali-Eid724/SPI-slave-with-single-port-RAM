# SPI-slave-with-single-port-RAM
The design implements an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) slave module connected to a single-port RAM for data storage and retrieval. The SPI slave communicates with an external SPI master device through the standard SPI signals: SCLK (Serial Clock), MOSI (Master Out Slave In), MISO (Master In Slave Out), and SS (Slave Select).
